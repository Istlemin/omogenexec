# OmogenJudge

OmogenJudge is a judging system for programming contests.

It consists of a sandbox to (more) safely execute untrusted code, a judging server to evaluate solutions on problems,
and a web frontend server to provide a user interface.

The documentation for the system is in the [docs](/docs/index.md) folder.

A public instance of the server is hosted at [kodsport.dev](https://kodsport.dev).
